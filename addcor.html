        <h1>Welcome to the MathFun Addition Tutorial!</h1>
        <p>Earlier, we learned that subtraction is when you take things away. Now, we’ll explore addition, which is when you give or add things!</p>

        <p>Think about it like this: in the subtraction example, you were left with 3 slices of pizza. After finishing them, you’re still hungry, so you ask your mum for more, and she gives you 2 more slices. We can write this like:</p>

        <div class="math-equation">
            <p><strong>3 + 2 = 5</strong></p>
        </div>

        <p>It doesn’t matter in what order you add the numbers — you’ll still get the same result!</p>

        <h2>What is Addition?</h2>
        <p>Addition is easy because you're just adding more instead of taking away. But when the numbers get bigger, it can feel a bit tricky. That’s where a special trick called <strong>Breaking Apart Numbers</strong> comes in.</p>

        <h2>Breaking Apart Numbers</h2>
        <p>To make big additions easier, you can break the numbers into smaller parts (tens and ones), then add them separately. Let’s try it with this problem:</p>

        <div class="math-equation">
            <p><strong>65 + 78 = ?</strong></p>
        </div>

        <p><strong>Start by adding the ones:</strong><br>8 + 5 = 13</p>
        <p><strong>Now, add the tens:</strong><br>60 + 70 = 130</p>
        <p><strong>Finally, add the two results together:</strong><br>130 + 13 = 143</p>

        <p>So, <strong>65 + 78 = 143!</strong></p>
