        <h1>Welcome to the MathFun Subtraction Tutorial!</h1>
        <p>Today, you will learn how to subtract numbers in an easy and fun way!</p>

        <h2>What is Subtracting?</h2>
        <p>Subtracting is when you take some things away from a group. It’s like this: imagine you have a big pizza with 8 slices. Your sibling eats 5 slices. Now, you only have 3 slices left. We can write this like:</p>

        <div class="math-equation">
            <p><strong>8 - 5 = 3</strong></p>
        </div>

        <p>The first number (8) is how many slices you started with.<br>
           The second number (5) is how many slices were eaten.<br>
           The last number (3) is how many slices you have left.</p>

        <h2>How to Check Your Answer</h2>
        <p>Here’s a secret tip: you can check if your answer is correct by adding! Take the number of slices you have left (3) and the number of slices eaten (5) and add them together. If they equal the first number (8), your answer is correct!</p>

        <div class="math-equation">
            <p><strong>3 + 5 = 8 ✔️</strong></p>
        </div>

        <h2>Bigger Subtraction Problems</h2>
        <p>Now, let's try a bigger problem!</p>

        <div class="math-equation">
            <p><strong>124 - 78 = ?</strong></p>
        </div>

        <p>This is a bit trickier, but here’s a helpful tip:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Find out how many numbers you need to make 78 into 100. In this case, you need 22.</li>
            <li>Then, subtract 100 from 124: <strong>124 - 100 = 24</strong>.</li>
            <li>Now, add the number you found earlier (22) to 24: <strong>24 + 22 = 46</strong>.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>So, <strong>124 - 78 = 46!</strong></p>
        <p>With practice, this trick will make subtracting big numbers easier. And one day, you’ll be able to do it in your head!</p>
